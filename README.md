# sound_school_workshop_materials
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook, example data set and a link to the slides of a 2 hour Data sonification workshop 
I conducted for Sound School in Melbourne.

The presentation is available here: http://tiny.cc/osgxez
The presentation materials are not self-contained in that there was significant in person explanation and instruction in the workshop.
(Un)fortunately you can't hear all my jokes.

I will try and run a more indepth, technical workshop in the future.
