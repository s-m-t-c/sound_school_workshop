I conducted a 2 hour Data sonification workshop for Sound School in Melbourne.

It focused on a conceptual perspective of sonification and less so on specific tools to achieve it.

This repository contains a link to the slides along with a Jupyter notebook and example dataset.

The presentation is available here: http://tiny.cc/osgxez

The presentation materials are not self-contained in that there was significant in person explanation and instruction in the workshop. (Un)fortunately you can't hear all my jokes.

I will try and run a more indepth, technical workshop in the future.
